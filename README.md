## Abstract

This study delves into the interactions between education, marital status, and wages in Washington State. Findings reveal that marriage increases men's income by about 20%, and acquiring a master's degree boosts pay by a similar percentage compared to a bachelor's degree. These insights emphasize the influence of salaries on individuals' circumstances and quantitative variables' interaction.

## Introduction

We investigate how education, marital status, and gender affect income in Washington State. Higher education levels correspond to higher incomes, but gender pay inequality persists. This study explores these relationships, focusing on the gender pay gap and its link to educational attainment.

## Key Insights

- College-educated individuals tend to earn more.
- Women with high school education or less earn slightly less than men with the same education.
- Marriage and education significantly impact wages.
- Race affects income, with Asians earning the most and African Americans earning less.
- Males earn 52.3% more than females on average.

## Data and Models

- Data Source: 2021 American Community Survey (ACS)
- Sample Size: 25,374 observations
- Models: Economic and Econometric Models
- R2: 0.29 (explains 29% of wage variability)

## Conclusion

This paper uncovers the complex relationship between education, marital status, and wages. Age, gender, education, and race are key factors affecting income. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing wage disparities.
